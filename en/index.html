			<h3>Feeling stuck and discouraged when it's time to communicate in English?</h3>
			
			<p>Call me a mentor, a coach, a consultant, a personal trainer even. I specialize in helping folks get the most out of English. Don't get stuck lacking skills and confidence to express yourself effectively. I can help you overcome the hurdles to become more fluent, proficient, and successful. First, we'll zero in on the things you struggle with the most. Then, I'll show you exactly how to improve and work with you until you do.</p>
			<p>Whatever challenges you the most is what we'll tackle first. Are you struggling with a heavy accent? Slang? Idioms? Everyday speech? Specific jargon associated with a particular field or industry? Complex scenarios such as how to persuade others, give explanations, handle disagreements, and manage conflict? No matter what, I'll strive to build your confidence with every encounter and intervention.</p>
			<p><strong>Tier One</strong> is a premium service for those who are serious about improving their English. I provide one on one attention as often and as rigorous as you require. I accept a limited number of clients to maximize what I can offer each one.</p>
			<p>In every session I'll provide immediate feedback with suggestions you can use right away for better results. We'll use real world scenarios that fit your lifestyle and career path. You'll have the chance to practice, practice, practice in a safe, supportive atmosphere. I'll keep it real and relevant. No silly games. No wasted time. Strictly business. I offer editorial support to improve your writing and emphasize public speaking and presentation. All this comes with 24/7/365 access and availability on short notice.</p>
			<p>Problem oriented. Solution focused. One to one. On demand.</p>
			<p><strong>Tier One</strong> makes English work for you.</p>
