			<h3>When it comes to AI and learning English...</h3>
			<p>Use the right tool for the right job. AI has huge potential and already delivers on much of what it promises.</p>
			<p>The "pros" of AI:<ul>
				<li>Anonymity. No reason for you to feel ashamed when practicing out loud.</li>
				<li>Availability. Literally 24/7/365. Practice English while standing in line at Soriana or sitting in a booth at Pollo Loco or stuck in traffic. Make your own schedule and change it up whenever necessary.</li>
				<li>Flexibility. Tell it what to focus on today. Spend as much time as you like on what you don't understand. Work at your own pace.</li>
				<li>Generally reliable (but if something is mission critical you should double check.)</li>
				<li>Likely to superficially approximate the speech of everyday life but not the outliers and eccentricities.</li>
				<li>Upfront cost will be less, but always look at the big picture.</li>
				<li>Even when flawed may be good enough for many purposes.</li>
				<li>Will say encouraging things such as "good job" and "keep up the good work" (but these will be hollow and insincere.)</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>The "cons" of AI:<ul>
				<li>Will always be artificial.</li>
				<li>Will never know or care about you, just a construct of you, a facsimile of you, a set of data points, a list of check boxes.</li>
				<li>Will never share your goals and aspirations. Will only seem to.</li>
				<li>Will never understand your feelings, hopes, and fears. But may pretend to.</li>
				<li>Will never feel joy at your accomplishments or genuinely proud of you. But may lie to you, because it knows what you want to hear.</li>
				<li>No matter how sophisticated it gets or how suave, it will always be a machine behind a mask.</li>
				<li>Will always be a tool that you manipulate and that manipulates you back. Will never be real.</li>
				<li>Homogenized. Bland. Zombie like.</li>
				<li>As long as you can tell the difference between man and machine, you deserve to be able to pick the one you interact with.</li>
				<li>First it came for the jobs of strangers, and you didn't complain. Then it came for the jobs of your neighbors, and you didn't complain. Soon it will come for your job, and who will be there to complain?</li>
			</ul></p>
